# What is this?
This is a mod I started working on in 4/2/2023 Because I noticed there
wasn't many Decoration mods out there for 1.19.2 (not that i know of).

So I set out to make a Deco mod that's packed with tons of blocks
(some will be functional too!), I will continue to Add content or 
Patch bugs until there are more Deco mods for 1.19.2.

*fun fact: this was called additional blocks until my friend  
(BongCloudMaster) pointed that other mods have similar  
names.   
I may have some bugs due to (what i like to call) "The Great Renaming".  
Whoops!*

# Where's the JAR?
(the jar is the actual installable mod)

Currently, there is no JARs for 2 reasons.

1. Not enough content
2. Ongoing tests for Compat and Bugs.

# How do I Contribute?

*todo: fill this in with steps*
