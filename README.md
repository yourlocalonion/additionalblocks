# Info
This is a mod I started working on in 4/2/2023 because I noticed there
wasn't many decoration mods out there for 1.19.2 (not that i know of other than [Chipped](https://modrinth.com/mod/chipped), Check them out!).
So I set out to make a deco mod that's packed with tons of blocks,

I will continue to add content or patch bugs until there are more deco
mods for 1.19.2.


# Where's the JAR?
(the jar is the actual installable mod)

Currently, there is no JARs for 3 reasons.

1. Not enough content
2. Ongoing tests for compatibility with other mods and bugs.
3. ~~No Motivation (very common lmao)~~
