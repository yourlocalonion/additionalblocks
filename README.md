# Info
This is a mod I started working on in 4/2/2023 Because I noticed there
wasn't many Decoration mods out there for 1.19.2 (not that i know of).

So I set out to make a Deco mod that's packed with tons of blocks
(some are functional too!), I will continue to Add content or 
Patch bugs until there are more Deco mods for 1.19.2.

# Where's the JAR?
(the jar is the actual installable mod)

Currently, there is no JARs for 2 reasons.

1. Not enough content
2. Ongoing tests for Compat and Bugs.

# How do I Contribute?

*todo: fill this in with steps*
